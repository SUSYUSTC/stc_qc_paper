# Repo for paper: stochastic tensor contraction for quantum chemistry, arXiv:2602.17158

The repo includes a closed-shell STC-CCSD(T) implementation based on pytorch.
Just-in-time (JIT) compilation is heavily used, so there's some compilation time for each python run.
See directory `run` for the script and commands to reproduce the main text results, and `figures` for the generation of data figures in the main text and SI.
